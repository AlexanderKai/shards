**Implemented enhancements:**

- Encapsulate Shards **State** in its own module: `shards_state`.

- Fix `shards_dist` to handle `auto_eject_nodes` flag and/or unexpected errors.
- Implement basic select/match functions for `shards_dist` module.
- Configurable shards_owner_sup strategy, by means of restart_strategy option.

- Make distribution function to pick shard/node configurable. [\#9](https://github.com/cabol/shards/issues/9)
